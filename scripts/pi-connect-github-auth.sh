# pi-connect-github-auth.sh — bootstrap GitHub App git auth on a Pi that you
# can only reach through a terminal.
#
# The scp-based flow in the README assumes you can copy files onto
# the Pi. Raspberry Pi Connect's web shell gives you a terminal and nothing
# else, so this script takes the one thing a browser terminal can deliver —
# pasted text — and asks for the PEM directly.
#
# Paste into the Pi Connect shell (https://connect.raspberrypi.com/devices):
#
#   curl -fsSL -o /tmp/gh-auth.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GTMichelli-Dev/pi-git-auth/main/scripts/pi-connect-github-auth.sh
#   bash /tmp/gh-auth.sh </dev/tty
#
# The `</dev/tty` matters: without it the prompts below would eat whatever
# else is sitting in the terminal's paste buffer instead of waiting for you.
#
# Idempotent — re-run it to refresh the helpers or replace the key.
